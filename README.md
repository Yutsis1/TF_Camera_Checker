# TF_Camera_Checker
This simple neuronet which use keras and have to choose between 2 variants:
- KIA Rio
- Chevrolet Niva
 In _img_ path saved images of both variants and in _test_ path put pictures in which neuronet should identify car type
 
 I didn't find a lot images from traffic cameras and I had to make _img_compil.py_.It script should make mirror copy and copies with
 more bright and less bright. That's make more pictures and halp to learn neuronet
 
 _main.py_ script which learn neuronet and _netkek.py_ script which should make a predictions about cars pictures in _test_
